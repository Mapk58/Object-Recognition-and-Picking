# Object-Recognition-and-Picking
This project is a part of Master's Computer Vision course at Innopolis University

## Idea: 
Our project is a set of methods and algorithms for working with a manipulator, on which an RGBD camera and a grip are attached, which allows you to capture objects.
In this project we are focusing on the following tasks: 
1. **Table Position Calibration :** Since the table under the camera may have a certain angle, it is necessary to automatically determine the angle of inclination and other parameters. 
2. **Object detection :** Using a depth map and a color image allows you to determine the number and size of objects, as well as their position and orientation relative to the table coordinate system.
3. **Object recognition:** Using pre-trained YOLO will allow us to recognize objects on the table, which will make it possible to give human-readable commands to the manipulator.
